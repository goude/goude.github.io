## Habitoids for t/

also terminal stuff

Got it. If we think of Habit-lets / Skill-lets as tiny, universally useful practices — each one small enough to be done by anyone, anywhere, but powerful if repeated — here’s a list of 50, ranked roughly by usefulness (highest leverage habits first, then descending).

⸻

Top Tier: Core Daily Regulators 1. Drink a glass of water after waking. 2. 3 deep belly breaths before starting work. 3. Stand and stretch once every hour. 4. Write down tomorrow’s top 3 tasks before bed. 5. Go outside for at least 10 minutes of daylight daily. 6. Walk 5 minutes after meals. 7. Set a consistent wake-up time (even weekends). 8. One piece of fruit per day. 9. 10 squats or pushups anytime in the day. 10. Smile at one person daily.

⸻

Mid Tier: Mind & Mood Builders 11. Write one sentence of gratitude each evening. 12. Notice and name one body sensation (Body Compass check). 13. Name your emotion once a day (“I feel…”). 14.

Take stairs instead of elevator once daily. 26. Stop eating when 80% full (notice satiety). 27. Set a bedtime “wind-down” cue (light, sound, or ritual). 28. Spend 2 minutes outside in silence. 29. Do one household task mindfully (washing dish, folding). 30. Keep a fruit or nut snack within reach.

⸻

Social & Connection Builders 31. Learn and use one new person’s name. 32. Ask “How are you really?” once this week. 33. Say thank you out loud at least once a day. 34. Make eye contact during one conversation. 35. Listen without interrupting for 1 minute. 36. Share one positive observation with a family member. 37. Check in with a friend weekly. 38. Offer a small act of service (hold door, carry bag). 39. Compliment someone’s effort, not just result. 40. Put the phone down when someone speaks to you.

⸻

Growth & Curiosity Habits 41. Write down one interesting fact you learned. 42. Ask one genuine question daily. 43. Try one new food per week. 44. Listen to 5 minutes of a podcast/lecture. 45. Do one small thing left-handed (if right-handed). 46. Sketch or doodle for 2 minutes. 47. Read a headline from another country’s news. 48. Look up one word you don’t know. 49. Recall one childhood memory and smile at it. 50. Ask yourself: “What’s one small thing I can improve today?”

⸻

👉 Why these 50? They’re:
• Universal — useful for kids, adults, elders.
• Small — most take under 2 minutes.
• Habit-lets — each is a seed; repeat and it grows into resilience.

⸻

D, do you want me to also categorize these into Habit-lets vs. Habit-lings (ready-to-use vs. in-training/growing ones)? That way the list becomes a dual-tier toolkit.
