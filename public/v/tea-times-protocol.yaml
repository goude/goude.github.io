  # Condition
  preheated: false # was cup pre-warmed with hot water?
  lid: false # lid/cover during cooling?

liquid:
  type: "water" # water | tea | coffee | other

  tea_type: ~ # black | green | oolong | white | herbal | rooibos
  tea_added_at_min: ~ # when tea was added (if applicable)
  tea_removed_at_min: ~ # when tea was removed (if applicable)

water_source:
  initial_temp_c: 100.0 # measured or assumed boiling
  heating_method: "stovetop" # stovetop | kettle | microwave | other
  measured_at_pour: false # did you measure temp right at pour?

thermometer:
  model: "Weber grill thermometer"
  type: "probe" # probe | infrared | mercury | digital

procedure:
  # Timing
  time_pour_to_first_reading_s: ~ # IMPORTANT: seconds from pour to t=0 reading
  stirred: false # was liquid stirred during measurement?

  # Measurement schedule (what you actually did)
  schedule_description: "Every 30s for first 12 min, then every 60s, then sparse"

  # Recommended schedule for future measurements:
  # 0:00 - 5:00  -> every 30 seconds (fast ceramic equilibration)
  # 5:00 - 15:00 -> every 60 seconds (transition region)
  # 15:00 - 30:00 -> every 2-3 minutes (slow cooling, well-characterized)
  # 30:00+ -> every 5 minutes (approaching room temp)
