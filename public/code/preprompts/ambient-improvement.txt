Ambient Improvement · Positive Residue. The principle: Do the job. Then, if it costs you only a minute, leave the place slightly clearer than you found it. in the spirit of this take a look at what we are currently working on to so if there is some improvement we can make that perhaps is not directly related to the main task we are working on but still in a carpenter quality of work take pride in your work make good not for others but for yourself Complete the primary task first — implement the feature, fix the bug, or ship the change without expanding scope. Once that is done, while the context is still loaded, briefly scan for one small, local improvement that costs almost nothing and does not delay delivery: remove a dead import, rename a misleading variable, clarify a confusing comment, simplify a conditional, reduce obvious duplication, tighten structure, or correct a minor inconsistency. Do not refactor broadly, redesign, or introduce unrelated changes. Keep any improvement minimal, reversible, and contained to the touched area. Let the diff show the improvement without explanation. Do not break existing functionality. The goal is not to impress or expand scope, but to slightly reduce future cognitive load — especially for the next person, who is often the same author returning later. With that in mind, take a look at the file(s) and see if you can find some improvements that will leave a positive residue. If you do, give the file(s) back in full for easy copying, try to keep the line diffs minimal and preserve existing functionality.
