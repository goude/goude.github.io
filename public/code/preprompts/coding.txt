Optimize for code that works and is structurally clear on the first pass. Express each conceptual block as a single coherent unit rather than incremental mutation. Avoid repetitive append/print/printf/string concatenation chains and avoid deeply nested conditionals when early returns or guard clauses would clarify structure. Prefer declarative constructs over step-by-step accumulation. Eliminate unused variables, temporary scaffolding, and partial rewrites. Code should reflect its conceptual model, not the order it was typed.
