  <p>
    <strong>You know that moment</strong> when someone says "don't forget about the
    thing!" and you have to scroll back through 47 messages to find what "thing"
    they mean?
  </p>

  <p>
    Yeah, that's <strong>Link Laziness</strong>. Here's how to fix it forever.

  <section>
    <h2 id="golden-rule">üéØ The Golden Rule</h2>
    <p><strong>When you remind, always relink.</strong></p>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Link Laziness = referencing something without providing access to it
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2 id="problem">The Problem Everyone Recognizes</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>‚ùå Link Lazy:</strong> "Don't forget to submit your timesheet!"
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>‚úÖ Not Link Lazy:</strong> "Don't forget to submit your timesheet:
      [timesheet.company.com]"
    </p>

    <p>One version makes you hunt. One version gets things done.</p>

    <h2 id="common-traps">You're Probably Doing This Too</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>"As I mentioned earlier..." <em>(but where?)</em></li>
      <li>
        "The form I shared yesterday..." <em>(which form? when yesterday?)</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        "Check the pinned message..." <em>(in which channel? from when?)</em>
      </li>
      <li>"It's in the email I sent..." <em>(I get 200 emails a day)</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Sound familiar? We all do this. It's fixable.</p>

    <h2 id="why-matters">Why This Actually Matters</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Higher response rates</strong>: One click beats a treasure hunt
      every time<br />
      <strong>Less frustration</strong>: No more "where was that again?" moments<br
      />
      <strong>Saves everyone time</strong>: Stop the scroll-and-search dance<br
      />
      <strong>More inclusive</strong>: Helps people who joined late or missed
      context
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2 id="the-fix">The Fix (3 Simple Rules)</h2>

    <p>‚úÖ <strong>Relink every time</strong> - even if you just shared it</p>
    <p>
      ‚úÖ <strong>Assume fresh eyes</strong> - they're seeing your reminder in isolation
    </p>
    <p>
      ‚úÖ <strong>Redundancy beats confusion</strong> - when in doubt, include it
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="make-it-stick">Make It Stick</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Call it out friendly</strong>: "Oops, bit of Link Laziness there -
      could you relink that?"<br />
      <strong>Lead by example</strong>: Always relink in your own reminders<br
      />
      <strong>Normalize it</strong>: Make it weird NOT to include links
