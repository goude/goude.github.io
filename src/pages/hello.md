## Hi, thanks for reaching out 👋

To help me respond faster and more effectively (and protect focus time 🧠), I really appreciate if **you can include everything relevant in your first message**. This means:

- Say hello if you'd like, but **then go straight to your question** [^1] ✍️
- Please do not use @ mentions in 1:1 chats — it will not speed up my response 🚫
- Include **enough context** for me to understand and act on it 🔍
  - For example: ticket number, what you've tried, what you're blocked on.
- If it's urgent, feel free to say so 🚨. But otherwise, I'll reply as soon as I’m able 💬

This saves time for both of us, and lets me give you a clearer answer without needing a full chat-style back-and-forth.

Here's an example:

> Hey Daniel — quick question re: INC12345. We’re getting a timeout in step 2 of the pipeline after yesterday’s change. Logs here: [link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ). Do you know if anything changed on your side?

Thanks for helping make things smoother! 🙏
