# Creating Inclusive Entry Points: A Guide for Project Leaders

## What This Guide Is About

This guide helps you create project entry points that work for everyone‚Äîincluding people who process information differently, have varying comfort levels with authority, or experience anxiety around new situations. Think of it as designing a welcoming front door rather than a checkpoint.

## The Core Principle: Design for Different Brains

People approach new information with different needs:

- Some want comprehensive details upfront
- Others prefer high-level context first
- Some need to understand the "why" before the "what"
- Others want to jump straight to action
- Many need to feel autonomous in how they engage

An inclusive entry point accommodates all these styles without forcing anyone into a single approach.

## Structure Your Entry Point

### 1. Start with Orientation (The "You Are Here" Section)

**What it is:** A brief, anxiety-reducing overview that helps people understand where they are and what to expect.

**Include:**

- Project name and one-sentence purpose
- How long this entry point takes to read (e.g., "5-minute overview")
- What you'll know after reading it
- Who this is for

**Example:**

> **Welcome to Project Aurora** > _A 5-minute orientation to our customer onboarding redesign_
>
> After reading this, you'll know what we're building, who's involved, and how to plug in. This is for anyone joining the project‚Äîwhether you're leading a workstream or contributing occasionally.

### 2. Provide Multiple Navigation Paths

**Create clear sections for different needs:**

- **üéØ Just Need the Basics?** - Core context only
- **üîç Want the Full Picture?** - Comprehensive background
- **‚ö° Ready to Contribute?** - Jump to current work
- **ü§ù Looking for People?** - Team contacts and roles
- **üìã Need Resources?** - Tools, templates, references

This allows people to choose their own level of engagement rather than forcing them through a linear process.

### 3. Use Invitational Language

**Instead of commands, use:**

- "You might want to..." instead of "You should..."
- "Here's what's worked for others..." instead of "Follow these steps..."
- "Feel free to..." instead of "Make sure you..."
- "One approach is..." instead of "The way to do this is..."

**Frame information as offerings:**

- "If you're wondering about X, here's what we know..."
- "Some people find it helpful to..."
- "In case it's useful, here's..."

### 4. Lead with Context and Choice

**For each section, provide:**

**Context First:** Why does this matter? What problem does it solve?
**Multiple Options:** Different ways to engage or approach the work
**Outcome Focus:** What success looks like, not just how to get there

**Example:**

> **Current Sprint Goals**
>
> _Why this matters:_ We're trying to reduce customer drop-off in the first week by 30%.
>
> _Ways to contribute:_
>
> - Review user research findings and add insights
> - Prototype new onboarding flows
> - Test current prototypes with users
> - Help refine our success metrics
>
> _What we're aiming for:_ A redesigned flow ready for A/B testing by month-end

### 5. Make Information Scannable

**Use visual hierarchy:**

- Clear headings and subheadings
- Bullet points for easy scanning
- Bold key information
- White space between sections
- Icons or emojis for visual navigation cues

**Chunk information:**

- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences)
- Group related information together
- Use collapsible sections for optional details

### 6. Address Anxiety and Uncertainty

**Include reassuring information:**

- "Don't worry if this feels overwhelming at first"
- "Questions are expected and welcome"
- "There's no wrong way to get started"
- "You won't break anything by exploring"

**Normalize different engagement styles:**

- "Some people prefer to lurk and observe first‚Äîthat's totally fine"
- "Others like to jump right in‚Äîboth approaches work"
- "If you need time to process before contributing, take it"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ‚ùå The Information Dump

Creating a wall of text that overwhelms rather than orients. Solution: Use progressive disclosure‚Äîstart small, link to details.

### ‚ùå The Assumption Trap

Assuming everyone has the same background knowledge or work style. Solution: Define terms and provide multiple entry paths.

### ‚ùå The Authority Voice

Using commanding language that triggers resistance. Solution: Frame as collaboration and offering choices.

### ‚ùå The Stale Monument

Creating a beautiful entry point that never gets updated. Solution: Build in maintenance rhythms and shared ownership.

### ‚ùå The Everything Bagel

Trying to include every possible piece of information. Solution: Focus on orientation and link out to specifics.

## Maintenance and Evolution

### Assign Clear Ownership

- One person owns keeping it current
- But multiple people contribute updates
- Regular review schedule (monthly/quarterly)
- Clear process for suggesting changes

### Build in Feedback Loops

- "How was your onboarding experience?" surveys
- Regular check-ins with new team members
- Anonymous feedback options
- Iteration based on actual usage patterns

### Keep It Living

- Update project status regularly
- Archive outdated information
- Add new sections as needs emerge
- Remove sections that no longer serve

## Testing Your Entry Point

**Try the "Fresh Eyes" test:**

- Ask someone unfamiliar with the project to use it
- Watch where they get stuck or confused
- Note what questions they still have afterward
- Iterate based on their experience

**Check for accessibility:**

- Can someone with limited time find what they need quickly?
- Does it work for people with different processing styles?
- Is the language welcoming rather than gatekeeping?
- Are there multiple ways to engage?

## Example Template

```markdown
# [Project Name]: Start Here

## You Are Here

[Brief orientation - what, why, how long to read]

## Choose Your Path

üéØ **New to this project?** ‚Üí [Basic overview]
‚ö° **Ready to contribute?** ‚Üí [Current work]
üîç **Need full context?** ‚Üí [Comprehensive background]
ü§ù **Looking for people?** ‚Üí [Team directory]
üìã **Need tools/resources?** ‚Üí [Resource hub]

## What We're Building

[One paragraph: problem, solution, impact]

## How to Plug In

- Current priorities: [3 key areas]
- Ways to contribute: [Multiple options]
- Getting started: [Gentle next steps]

## Key People

[Names, roles, best way to reach them]

## Questions?

- Try [resource] first
- Ask in [channel/forum]
- Or reach out to [person]

_Last updated: [Date] | Maintained by: [Person]_
```

## Remember

The goal isn't to eliminate all confusion‚Äîit's to make the path forward clear and welcoming for people with different needs and processing styles. A good entry point feels like a helpful guide, not a gatekeeper.

Your entry point is working when people can find their footing quickly and feel confident about how to engage, regardless of their working style or neurotype.
