# When You Know What to Do But Can’t Make Yourself Do It: Understanding Executive Function Breakdowns

## The Phone Battery Scenario: A Perfect Example

You know you need to charge your phone before going out for a long day. You’ve been reminded multiple times. You understand the consequences - your phone will die, you’ll be disconnected, maybe even in trouble or unsafe. Yet somehow, you walk out the door with a 15% battery.

Your parents are frustrated because from their perspective, this is simple: “Just plug in your phone!” They’ve told you dozens of times. They don’t understand why you keep “choosing” to ignore something so obvious.

But here’s the truth: **this isn’t about not caring, being lazy, or deliberately ignoring good advice. This is about executive function - the brain systems that translate “knowing what to do” into “actually doing it.”**

## What’s Really Happening: The Knowing-Doing Gap

Your brain has different systems that handle different jobs:

**The Knowledge System:** Stores information about what you should do

- “Phones need to be charged”
- “Low battery means problems later”
- “Parents get upset when I forget”

**The Executive Function System:** Actually manages the doing

- Remembering to act on the knowledge at the right moment
- Switching from your current activity to the charging task
- Estimating how long charging will take
- Integrating the charging task into your departure routine

**The gap:** You can have perfect knowledge but impaired executive function. It’s like having a brilliant advisor who knows exactly what to do, but a broken communication system between the advisor and the person who actually carries out the tasks.

## Why “Just Do It” Doesn’t Work: The Hidden Complexity

What looks like one simple task - “charge your phone” - actually requires multiple executive function skills working together:

### Task Initiation (Getting Started)

- Breaking away from your current activity (scrolling, getting dressed, eating breakfast)
- Switching mental gears from “current thing” to “phone charging thing”
- Overcoming the invisible resistance to starting a new task

### Working Memory (Holding Multiple Things in Mind)

- Remembering you need to charge the phone while also thinking about getting ready, what you need to bring, what time you need to leave
- Keeping track of where your charger is
- Remembering how long charging usually takes

### Time Management (Planning and Estimation)

- Estimating how long you have before leaving
- Calculating whether there’s enough time for meaningful charging
- Planning when to unplug the phone and pack it

### Task Switching (Moving Between Activities)

- Stopping what you’re doing to plug in the phone
- Remembering to check on it later
- Switching back to finish getting ready

### Impulse Control and Delay of Gratification

- Choosing the boring task (charging) over the interesting task (whatever you’re currently doing)
- Waiting for the phone to charge instead of just leaving with whatever battery you have

**When any of these systems is struggling, the whole process breaks down, even though you “know” what to do.**

## Why Some Brains Struggle More

### ADHD Brains

- Difficulty with task initiation (“I’ll do it in a minute” becomes an hour)
- Working memory challenges (forget about the phone while focusing on other morning tasks)
- Time blindness (poor estimation of how long things take)
- Hyperfocus (get absorbed in something else and lose awareness of time/tasks)

### Autistic Brains

- Difficulty with task switching (breaking away from current activity feels jarring)
- Executive function can be depleted by other demands (social masking, sensory processing)
- May need more explicit routines and systems to remember multi-step processes
- Can struggle with prioritizing when multiple tasks seem equally important

### AuDHD Brains (Autism + ADHD)

- **The Double Bind**: ADHD creates need for flexibility and novelty, autism creates need for routine and predictability
- **Competing executive function demands**: ADHD says “switch tasks for stimulation,” autism says “don’t break the routine”
- **Energy drain conflicts**: Social masking (autism) depletes the energy needed for task initiation (ADHD)
- **Hyperfocus vs routine rigidity**: Can get stuck in autism routine OR ADHD hyperfocus, both preventing phone charging
- **Sensory overload affecting working memory**: Autism sensory issues make ADHD working memory problems worse
- **The system that worked yesterday might not work today**: Need multiple backup systems because brain state varies dramatically

### Anxious Brains

- May avoid the task because thinking about consequences creates anxiety
- Can get stuck in analysis paralysis about the “perfect” time to charge
- May procrastinate on tasks associated with previous conflicts or stress

### Gifted/High IQ Brains

- May rely too heavily on being able to figure things out on the spot rather than building consistent systems
- Can underestimate how much executive function is required for “simple” tasks
- May have uneven development where intellectual abilities outpace executive function skills

### All Developing Brains

- Executive function develops slowly and isn’t fully mature until mid-twenties
- Can be inconsistent - working fine one day, completely breaking down the next
- Stress, fatigue, and competing demands make it worse

## The Parent Frustration Cycle

From a parent’s perspective, this pattern is maddening:

1. **They see the logic clearly:** “Phone needs charging. We’re going out. Charge the phone.”
1. **They assume understanding equals ability:** “If you understand why it’s important, you should be able to do it.”
1. **They interpret forgetting as defiance:** “I’ve told you this 50 times. You’re choosing to ignore me.”
1. **They escalate consequences:** “Maybe getting in trouble will make you remember.”
1. **Nothing changes, frustration increases:** “Why is this so hard? It’s just plugging in a phone!”

The parent is trying to solve an executive function problem with logic and consequences, which is like trying to fix a broken arm with a math lesson.

## Working Solutions: Building Systems That Actually Help

### Environmental Design (Make It Easier)

**Reduce the executive function load:**

- Keep chargers in obvious places (by the door, with your keys)
- Use wireless charging pads that require less precise plugging-in
- Set up charging stations in high-traffic areas
- Keep a portable battery pack as backup

**Visual/Physical reminders:**

- Put your charger with tomorrow’s clothes the night before
- Set phone on charger as part of bedtime routine
- Use a charging checklist stuck to your mirror or door

### Routine Integration (Attach to Existing Habits)

Instead of remembering a separate “charge phone” task, attach it to something you already do consistently:

- **Night before:** “When I set my morning alarm, I put my phone on the charger”
- **Morning routine:** “When I brush my teeth, my phone goes on charger”
- **Departure routine:** “Before I put on shoes, I check my phone battery”

### Technology Assists

**Phone settings:**

- Low battery notifications at 30% and 20%
- Automatic “charge reminder” alarms the night before big days
- Widget showing battery percentage on home screen

**Smart home solutions:**

- Smart plugs that can be voice-activated
- Charging pads with lights/sounds that indicate charging status

### Time and Energy Management

**Recognize when executive function is depleted:**

- Mornings after poor sleep
- During stressful periods
- When rushing or running late
- When managing multiple new or complex tasks

**Plan accordingly:**

- Charge phone the night before during high-stress periods
- Use backup battery packs when you know you’ll be scattered
- Ask for help or reminders when you’re overwhelmed

### Communication Strategies with Parents

**Help them understand the real problem:**

- “I know I should charge my phone. The hard part isn’t understanding - it’s remembering to do it when I’m thinking about 10 other things.”
- “My brain is good at learning information but not as good at managing all the steps to act on it.”
- “When I forget, it’s not because I don’t care. It’s because my executive function is overwhelmed.”

**Ask for specific help:**

- “Can you help me figure out a system instead of just reminding me again?”
- “I need to build this into a routine. Can we brainstorm how?”
- “The nagging makes me feel worse but doesn’t actually help me remember. Can we try a different approach?”

### Self-Compassion and Perspective

**This is a skill deficit, not a character flaw:**

- You’re not lazy, defiant, or uncaring
- Executive function develops at different rates for different people
- Having to build systems for things others do automatically doesn’t make you broken

**Progress over perfection:**

- Focus on improving the pattern rather than never forgetting
- Celebrate when your systems work, even if they don’t work every time
- Adjust systems when they stop working rather than abandoning them entirely

## Advanced Strategies for Persistent Problems

### The Implementation Intention Technique

Instead of vague intentions like “I need to charge my phone,” create specific if-then plans:

- “If I’m getting ready to go out for more than 4 hours, then I check my battery first”
- “If my battery is below 50% and I’m leaving soon, then I plug it in immediately”
- “If I’m setting my alarm before bed, then I put my phone on the charger”

### The Two-Phone System

For chronically forgetful phone chargers:

- Keep an older phone as backup, always charged
- Use a portable battery pack as your “second phone battery”
- Family emergency phone that stays charged in the car

### The Energy Audit

Track when you’re most likely to forget:

- Time of day (rushed mornings? tired evenings?)
- Stress levels (exams, family conflicts, social events?)
- Competing demands (getting ready for important events?)

Use this data to build targeted interventions for your high-risk situations.

### Working with Different Brain Types

**For ADHD brains:**

- Use timers and alarms extensively
- Build in extra buffer time for charging
- Create dopamine rewards for successful charging (favorite music while phone charges)

**For AuDHD brains:**

- Build multiple backup systems since brain state varies dramatically
- Create “interrupt protocols” for when hyperfocus prevents task switching
- Use body doubling or timers to bridge the gap between rigid routine and ADHD flexibility needs
- Accept that systems may need frequent adjustment as competing needs shift

**For anxious brains:**

- Address the anxiety around conflict rather than just the charging
- Practice self-forgiveness when you forget
- Create backup plans that reduce stakes

## For Parents: How to Actually Help

### Instead of: “Just remember to charge your phone!”

**Try:** “Let’s figure out a system that makes this automatic for you.”

### Instead of: “You’re old enough to remember this!”

**Try:** “Your brain is still developing the skills to manage multiple tasks. Let’s work with how it actually works right now.”

### Instead of: “Why is this so hard for you?”

**Try:** “This seems to be a challenging area for your brain. What kind of support would help?”

### Instead of: Consequences and punishments

**Try:** Environmental changes and system-building

### Remember:

- Executive function challenges are real neurological differences, not character flaws
- Punishment and frustration don’t improve executive function
- Systems and supports do improve executive function
- This gets better with time, practice, and appropriate accommodations

## The Bigger Picture

The phone charging problem is rarely about phone charging. It’s about learning to work with your actual brain rather than the brain you think you should have.

**Skills you’re really building:**

- Self-awareness about your executive function patterns
- System creation and problem-solving
- Self-advocacy in relationships
- Resilience when systems break down
- Self-compassion during the learning process

These skills will serve you in every area of life - work, relationships, health, creative projects. Learning to manage your executive function challenges now builds the foundation for success in much bigger challenges later.

**Remember:** Needing systems and supports doesn’t make you broken. It makes you human, with a particular kind of brain that works best with particular kinds of help.
