      <h2 id="sidenotes">Sidenotes: Footnotes and Marginal Notes</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style is his extensive
        use of sidenotes.<label
          for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes"
          class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input
          type="checkbox"
          id="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes"
          class="margin-toggle"
        /><span class="sidenote">This is a sidenote.</span> Sidenotes are like footnotes,
        except they don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the
        page, but instead display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have
        noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want a sidenote without footnote-style numberings, then you want
        a margin note.
        <label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle" />
        <span class="marginnote">
          This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
        </span> On large screens, a margin note is just a sidenote that omits the
        reference number. This lessens the distracting effect taking away from the
        flow of the main text, but can increase the cognitive load of matching a
        margin note to its referent text. However, on small screens, a margin note
        is like a sidenote except its viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than
        a reference number. This document currently uses the symbol &#8853; (<code
          >&amp;#8853;</code
        >), but it’s up to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Margin notes are created just like sidenotes, but with the <code
          >marginnote</code
        > class for the content and the <code>margin-toggle</code> class for the
        label and dummy checkbox. For instance, here is the code for the margin note
        used in the previous paragraph:
