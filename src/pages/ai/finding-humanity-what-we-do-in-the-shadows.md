# Finding Humanity in Immortality: Themes of Identity, Belonging, and Growth in _What We Do in the Shadows_

_Authorship: ChatGPT o1/4o. Revision 1._

One of the most compelling aspects of _What We Do in the Shadows_ is its ability to explore profound themes under the guise of absurdity. At its heart, the show is a meditation on identity—both personal and collective. Each character wrestles with the weight of centuries-old vampire customs while trying to find a place in the modern world. Nandor’s internal conflict, as he struggles to reconcile his ancient lineage with his longing for meaningful relationships, captures the universal challenge of integrating the past with the present. Guillermo’s journey, meanwhile, is especially poignant: his lifelong dream of becoming a vampire, something he admires and fears, mirrors the tension we all feel when striving to break free from the roles assigned to us.

The theme of belonging is equally central. Despite their squabbles and centuries of accumulated baggage, the vampires form a makeshift family. This unlikely camaraderie underscores the human need for acceptance and connection. Guillermo, caught between his role as a loyal familiar and his aspirations for vampirism, embodies the shifting nature of identity and community. His dilemma reflects the often uncomfortable, yet necessary, evolution of relationships and the search for where we truly belong.

The show cleverly juxtaposes the absurdity of ancient vampire hierarchies with modern bureaucracy, revealing a deeper commentary on the structures that govern our lives. Whether it’s navigating city council meetings or participating in a vampire theater group, the characters encounter the stifling absurdities of institutional systems. By placing supernatural beings in mundane scenarios, the show gently mocks the red tape and rigidity we so often accept without question. It suggests that these systems, no matter how entrenched, are human inventions that, like vampire traditions, might benefit from scrutiny—or even a dose of irreverence.

Yet beneath the comedy lies a poignant meditation on growth, or the lack thereof. Immortality, paradoxically, can breed stagnation. Characters like Nadja, whose foray into Wall Street ends with mixed results, and Colin Robinson, whose unusual maturation reveals unexpected depths, highlight the importance of personal transformation. The vampires’ near-unchanging existence serves as a cautionary tale: resisting change comes at a cost. It’s the human aspects of characters like Guillermo—and the occasional flicker of humanity in the vampires themselves—that remind us growth requires vulnerability, risk, and stepping outside old routines.

The show also holds up a mirror to the absurdity of life itself. Its mockumentary format invites viewers to reflect on their own rituals and routines. By framing timeless human struggles in the context of vampire lore, the series satirizes and celebrates our collective yearning for connection, meaning, and belonging—even if that belonging is in a dusty coffin or a crumbling mansion. In its meta moments, the show reminds us that life, like any good story, is fleeting. The bonds we form, no matter how unconventional, make the experience worthwhile.

## Tradition Versus Change: A Delicate Balance

One of the show’s most illuminating themes is the tension between tradition and adaptation. The centuries-old vampires find themselves thrust into a world dominated by smartphones, apps, and suburban monotony, and their discomfort underscores the inevitable march of time. For creatures with all the time in the world, their resistance to change is ironic, suggesting that true stagnation is self-imposed. Guillermo’s arc, too, highlights the courage needed to break free from inherited power structures. His transformation under Derek’s guidance rather than Nandor’s authority illustrates the bravery required to forge one’s own path. Yet this choice comes with consequences, complicating his bond with Nandor and straining his sense of belonging. It’s a nuanced portrayal of real-world truths: taking bold steps often brings both liberation and isolation.

Through humor, the show critiques the systems that shape our lives. The vampires’ ineptitude with modern tasks mirrors our own struggles with outdated customs, paperwork, and bureaucracy. Colin Robinson’s evolution—shifting from an energy-draining caricature to a layered character grappling with loneliness—provides an unexpected emotional depth. His transformation reminds us that even those stuck in seemingly static roles can find renewal if they’re willing to change.

Nadja’s Wall Street misadventures, meanwhile, reveal the pitfalls of chasing status or profit at the expense of authenticity. Her struggles serve as a reminder to stay rooted in one’s values, even when the allure of instant rewards is strong. By placing a vampire in the cutthroat world of corporate ambition, the show underscores the universality of these conflicts.

## The Layers of Laszlo

Among the ensemble, Laszlo might seem like the most unapologetically hedonistic. His centuries-old habits, flamboyant escapades, and attachment to the cursed witch skin hat create a picture of a character steeped in tradition and eccentricity. Yet Laszlo reveals surprising tenderness, particularly in his bond with Colin Robinson. What begins as exasperation evolves into a near-paternal relationship, with Laszlo guiding Colin through his bizarre maturation process. These moments of care add depth to Laszlo’s otherwise rakish persona.

His attachment to the witch skin hat, though often played for laughs, symbolizes his resistance to modern mundanity. By clinging to this relic, Laszlo asserts the importance of personal flair and tradition, even at the cost of practicality. His relationships with the other vampires balance affectionate teasing with genuine loyalty. His marriage to Nadja, comedic yet enduring, is a testament to love’s resilience across centuries. With Nandor, his dynamic offers a quieter camaraderie, balancing Nandor’s introspection with his own devil-may-care attitude.

Laszlo’s story shows how roles can shift in surprising ways. Beneath his flamboyant exterior lies a willingness to grow and adapt, proving that idiosyncrasies and transformation can coexist.

## Lessons from the Shadows

Ultimately, _What We Do in the Shadows_ is more than a comedy about vampires. It’s a meditation on change, connection, and the rituals that shape our lives. Guillermo’s bravery, Nadja’s missteps, and Colin Robinson’s unexpected growth all offer lessons about stepping beyond self-imposed limitations. Laszlo’s eccentricities remind us of the value of individuality, while the show’s humor illuminates life’s absurdities, inviting us to laugh at our own.

In the end, the series reminds us that life—whether immortal or fleeting—is shaped by the bonds we form and the stories we tell. By embracing humor and vulnerability, we might find the freedom to grow, adapt, and share more genuine connections with those we call friends, family, and maybe even the occasional vampire.
