    <h2>Entry Point</h2>

    <div class="tldr" role="note" aria-label="TL;DR">
      ðŸ§­ <strong>Entry Point</strong>: One link to start. Not a collection of
      URLsâ€”a single page that maps to everything else.
      <div class="subtle">
        The project equivalent of walking into a restaurant and finding the
        menu.
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      An entry point addresses a really simple question: 'what single piece of
      written information do I need to get started in this project?' Not a quick
      chat with someone who'll email you documents later. Just one place to
      start.
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine a restaurant with no menu. You ask a server who names a few dishes
      but not all, tells you to ask someone else who's on break. Others around
      you are doing the same dance. It sounds absurdâ€”but this is how many
      projects operate.
    </p>

    <p>
      In software, this problem was solved long ago: the <strong>README</strong>
      file. It's designed empathyâ€”written by someone who remembered being confused
      and took time to smooth the path for the next person.
    </p>

    <h2>What belongs on an entry point</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Project purpose:</strong> What are we building and why?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Key contacts:</strong> Who owns what and how to reach them
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Essential links:</strong> Repository, task board, documentation
      </li>
      <li><strong>Current priorities:</strong> What's happening now</li>
      <li>
        <strong>How to contribute:</strong> Clear next steps for newcomers
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="subtle">
      Think menu, not phone book. Curated essentials that orient fast.
    </p>

    <h2>Why this matters</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Faster onboarding:</strong> One tab instead of five, one conversation
        instead of a scavenger hunt
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reduced cognitive load:</strong> No more "where do I even start"
        paralysis
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Shared reality:</strong> Everyone works from the same understanding
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Invisible time savings:</strong> Eliminates the quiet tax of repeated
        orientation questions
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      (Pro tip: The first line should be "prefer talking? contact X to walk
      through this" because the real point isn't the formatâ€”it's ensuring
      someone owns the onboarding experience. Once you're onboarded, it becomes
      everyone's responsibility to keep improving it because we all remember
      what it felt like to be lost on day one.)
    </p>

    <h2>What this looks like</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Code project:</strong> The <code>README</code> already does thisâ€”extend
        the concept
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Business project:</strong> A single Confluence page, Notion doc,
        or even a well-organized Google Doc
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cross-functional effort:</strong> An index page linking to Jira,
        dashboards, meeting notes, and key decisions
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="subtle">
      It doesn't need to be fancy. It needs to exist and be maintained.
    </p>

    <h2>What I'm asking for</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>If your project has an entry point:</strong> Please send me that one
      link.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If it doesn't exist yet:</strong> Consider creating one. A simple page
      with the essentials above. Your future teammates (and future self) will thank
      you.
    </p>
    <p class="subtle">
      This isn't about process for process's sakeâ€”it's about recognizing that
      good onboarding is designed, not accidental.
