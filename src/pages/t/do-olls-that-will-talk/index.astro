      Have a listen to these two renditions of the Christmas classic composed by
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Willson"
        >Meredith Willson</a
      >. Pay particular attention to where the emphasis lands when singing the
      word "dolls".

    <h2>Bublé: on the Beat</h2>
    <p>
      Let’s start with one of the most famous contemporary versions. Bublé,
      smooth as ever, sits squarely on the beat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is the corresponding notation. Note the small triplet adjustment at
      the start: it mainly exists to make “A pair of” scan cleanly in MuseScore.
    </p>

    <h2>Como and the Fontane Sisters: the Canonical Version</h2>
    <p>
      Now for the original. Here, "dolls" arrives slightly before the bar. The
      first time around it’s sung by the Fontane Sisters; keep listening to hear
      Como’s even more pronounced offset, or
      <a href="#" id="skip-to-como">skip ahead to 1:54</a>
      if you’re impatient.
    </p>

    <figure class="video">
      <div id="player-como"></div>
    </figure>

    <p>
      In measure six, the word "dolls" enters late: on the final triplet
      subdivision of the bar, effectively a pickup into the next measure.
    </p>

    <h2>Audio Analysis</h2>

    <p>
      We can now zoom in on the Como recording and inspect the audio itself.
      When aligned against a click track, a subtle <em>ritardando</em> becomes visible:
      the tempo eases from roughly 117 BPM down toward 115 BPM across this phrase.
    </p>

    <p>
      The word <em>"do-olls"</em> appears clearly in the waveform as a distinctive
      two-humped shape just after the five-second mark. The initial syllable
      <em>"do-"</em> does not coincide with a beat; instead, it sits almost exactly
      midway between beat 4 of measure six and beat 1 of measure seven.
    </p>

    <p>
      This places the vocal entrance on the final eighth note of the bar (see
      measure nine). In other words, the notation captures the <em>idea</em> of the
      rhythm, but the performance itself leans even further forward than a strict
      triplet reading would suggest.
    </p>

    <p>Here is the section in question, with a playback interface:</p>

    <div id="waveform"></div>
    <div id="waveform-controls">
      <button id="play-pause">Play / Pause</button>
      <button id="reset">Reset</button>
    </div>

    <div id="legend">
      <div class="legend-item">
        <span class="legend-color" style="background: rgba(100, 100, 255, 0.4);"
        ></span>
        <span>Beats</span>
      </div>
      <div class="legend-item">
        <span class="legend-color" style="background: rgba(255, 50, 50, 0.6);"
        ></span>
        <span>Dolls</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The adapted notation looks like this:</p>

      <div id="osmd-container-eights" class="score"></div>
      <figcaption>Early last-eighth version.</figcaption>

    <p>However, it does not sound correct in playback. What to do?</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Easy Fix: Swing</h2>
    <p>
      There is, of course, a simpler solution: turn on swing. With swing
      enabled, the notation falls into place. The pickup can be written in
      straight eighths, and the “do-” syllable comfortably sits on an eighth
      note. The phrases “wish of” and “hope for” still require a
      dotted-eighth–sixteenth pattern to preserve the feel, but the overall
      rhythm now aligns naturally with the performance.

    <h2>Pushing Forward</h2>
    <p>
      The next step is to listen to a variety of recordings and see which
      emphasis style dominates. But a distraction appeared! so I’m off to learn
      more:
