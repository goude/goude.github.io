        When you touch a system, leave it slightly better than you found it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your job is to implement the feature, fix the bug, or ship the change.
        Do that first. But while you are there—while the file is open and the
        context is loaded in your head—look for one small improvement you can
        make without changing the scope of the work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rename a misleading variable. Delete a dead import. Clarify a comment
        that confused you. Tighten a conditional. Remove duplication you just
        tripped over.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a refactoring crusade. It is not a redesign. It is not an
        excuse to expand scope. It is a lightweight, opportunistic reduction of
        entropy.
      </p>

      <p>Think of it as positive residue.</p>

      <p>
        Every intervention leaves traces. The question is whether those traces
        increase or decrease friction for the next person—very often, that next
        person is you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, these micro-improvements compound. A codebase shaped by
        ambient improvement becomes easier to reason about. Intent surfaces.
        Edges soften. Surprises diminish.
      </p>

      <p>
        A codebase without it drifts. Nothing catastrophic happens. It simply
        becomes harder, year by year, to hold in your head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ambient improvement is a craft habit. It doesn’t need a meeting. It
        doesn’t need a policy. It needs restraint.
      </p>

      <p>Follow three rules:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Never let the improvement delay the primary task.</li>
        <li>Keep changes local and reversible.</li>
        <li>Leave evidence in the diff, not in a speech.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        You are not trying to impress. You are trying to reduce future cognitive
        load.
      </p>

      <p>The goal is not heroics. The goal is net-positive presence.</p>

      <p>Make it work. Then, if it costs you only a minute, make it clearer.</p>

      <p>That minute will pay interest.</p>
