      <!-- p: the default unit of explanation; keep one idea per paragraph -->
      <p class="subtitle">
        A sequence of “patch archetypes” designed to build control before
        complexity. Each patch is a small study: do it fast once, then repeat
        until it becomes boringly dependable.
      </p>
    </header>

    <p>
      The intent is not to collect presets, but to build a mental model: how
      oscillators, envelopes, filters, and modulation interact, and how little
      you can use while still making something expressive. If you want a
      constraint: avoid effects until the patch itself feels alive.

          This is the irreducible core: one oscillator, one filter, one
          envelope. The aim is to feel how much expression is available before
          you add layers that can hide weak articulation.

            Set one oscillator as carrier, another as modulator (FM). Keep
            filter mostly open with minimal resonance. Use amp envelope
            appropriate to bell/EP: quick attack, medium decay, moderate
            sustain, medium release. Control tone primarily with FM depth.

            A clear strike transient and harmonics that “sparkle” rather than
            fizz. If the tone is glassy, reduce FM depth before touching the
            filter.

          <dt>Further Ideas</dt>
          <dd>
            Map velocity to FM depth (small range) and compare to
            velocity-to-filter. Add a gentle high-pass (if available) to keep
            low-end clean without dulling the strike.

        <h3>Acid Bassline</h3>

        <p>
          This patch teaches how envelopes and resonance interact dynamically.
          The “acid” character is as much about performance variation as about
          the static settings.

          <dt>Goal</dt>
          <dd>
            Make a bassline sound that can be expressive with small changes:
            cutoff moves, envelope amount changes, and accent dynamics.
          </dd>

          <dt>Principle</dt>
          <dd>
            Resonance plus envelope amount creates vowel-like motion. The
            envelope defines how the “mouth” opens and closes; resonance defines
            how vocal it becomes.

            Saw or square into a resonant 24 dB filter. Resonance
            moderate-to-high (but not self-osc). Filter envelope: fast attack,
            short-to-medium decay, low sustain, strong amount. Use velocity as
            “accent” control (brighter and/or louder).

            A talking quality when cutoff moves. Accented notes should feel like
            they reshape the phrase, not just get louder. If it turns to
            whistle, reduce resonance before lowering cutoff.

            Map mod wheel to envelope amount for live “push.” Add a subtle drive

        <p>
          Ensemble sounds rely on many small instabilities rather than one large
          modulation. The trick is to imply “many players” without obvious
          wobble.

            Choose a stable oscillator base (saws/pulses/wavetables kept
            gentle). Use slow LFOs with very small depths. If you use wavetable
            motion, make it subtle and slow. Add performance controls
            (aftertouch, mod wheel) for intentional movement.

            A sound that stays “about one thing” over time. The harmonic content
            should drift without losing pitch center. If the pad becomes
            restless, reduce depth before changing rates.

          <dt>Further Ideas</dt>
          <dd>
            Create two versions: one with no effects, one with minimal reverb.
            The no-effects version should still feel complete. Then try mapping
            a single performance control to two targets (for example cutoff + FM
            depth), both in tiny ranges, to make one gesture feel rich.
