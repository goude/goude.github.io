# 🧭 A Simple and Single ENTRY POINT

Imagine walking into a restaurant. The first thing you look for is the menu:
one obvious place to see what's available and decide what to do next.

Now imagine a restaurant with no menu. You flag down a server. They name a few
dishes but not all. You're told to ask someone else. That person is on break.
You try again later. Others around you are doing the same.

It sounds absurd. But this is how many projects operate.

---

In software, the menu is the **README** file: shown front and center when you
join a codebase. You only need to know one thing to get started: where the
README is.

A good README isn't just a file. It's _designed empathy_: written by someone
who's been through the same confusion and took the time to smooth the path for
the next person. _Where do I start? How do I run this? Who do I talk to?_

The README has become a de facto standard because it works. If it were suddenly
missing, there would be widespread complaints: not out of pedantry, but because
it would waste everyone's time.

Now think about the last time you joined a non-software project:

- Someone sends a Teams chat with a PowerPoint 📎
- Then a SharePoint folder where documents go to die 📁
- Then a Confluence page last updated 8 months ago 🕸️
- When none of that helps, you ping Sarah, who's swamped, and she sends you to
  Mike, who eventually finds something buried in old emails 📬

This scavenger hunt, repeating for each new person in every project, is a
massive invisible tax. A quiet cost in time, attention, and morale.

## 🔖 The Missing Entry Point

What every project needs (and rarely has) is a **single Entry Point**: a "start
here" page that anticipates a newcomer's questions and links out to everything
else.

- What are we building and why?
- Who are the key people?
- Where are the tools and docs?
- What are the current priorities?
- How do I contribute?

Not a sprawling wiki. Not a link graveyard. Just one designed entry experience
that orients you fast and points clearly to what matters next.

This shouldn't be revolutionary. But somehow, it still is.

## ❓ So my questions

👉 What's the **project equivalent of a README** in your org? 👉 Who owns it:
and how do you balance clear ownership with shared responsibility so it
evolves, rather than decays?

If your team has something like this that works, I'd love to hear about it. And
if not — what's stopping us?

Feel free to tag someone who's built a great Entry Point 🧭 Or leave a 🧭 in
the comments if you've lived this scavenger hunt.
