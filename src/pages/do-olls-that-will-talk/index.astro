    This is writing practice.

    OPENING: THE HOOK
    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    You need ONE sentence that makes someone want to keep reading.

    Options to try:
    - Start with the moment you noticed it (concrete, sensory)
    - Start with the question itself
    - Start with the feeling of "can't unhear"

    Draft fragments to work from:
    - "This year I heard something I can't stop hearing."
    - "One word. One syllable. Two different placements."
    - "Michael Bublé says 'Dolls' on the beat. Perry Como says it before."
    - "Every December, the same itch."

    What made YOU notice? That's your opening.

    <p>[Your opening hook here]</p>

    <!--
    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    THE OBSERVATION
    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    State what you hear. Plain. No hedging.

    Structure:
    1. Bublé version: what happens rhythmically (on the beat / downbeat)
    2. Como version: what happens rhythmically (before the bar / anticipates)
    3. Why it matters to you (the feel, the push, the "cue")

    Musical terms you might use (or avoid):
    - downbeat vs upbeat/pickup
    - triplet feel
    - "anticipation" (the note that arrives early)
    - "lands" vs "pushes into"

    Keep it concrete. If you can hum it, describe it.

    <h2>The notation</h2>
    <!--
    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    THE SVG
    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    You made this in MuseScore → exported SVG → tweaked in Inkscape.
    That's interesting! The tech chain matters:

    - MuseScore for the notation itself
    - SVG export keeps it crisp at any size
    - Inkscape for any adjustments
    - Astro imports it with ?url for proper path handling

    You could mention this process, or not. Your call.

    <!--
    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    THE PERSONAL ANGLE (the "why I'm writing this")
    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    This is the emotional core. Some options:

    A) Be direct:
       "I notice this every time. Writing it down might let me stop."

    B) Frame it as a question:
       "Does anyone else hear this? I've never found anyone talking about it."

    C) Frame it as appreciation:
       "These tiny choices are what make arrangements feel different."

    D) Just end with the observation:
       Don't explain why you care. The fact that you made the page says enough.

    Which feels right?

    CLOSING
    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    Options:
    - End on the observation (no summary needed)
    - End on the feeling
    - End with an invitation (what do you hear?)
    - Just stop. The page made its point.
