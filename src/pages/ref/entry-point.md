## The Entry Point

One of the most overlooked aspects of any system—technical, organizational, or social—is the entry point: the place where a newcomer lands, trying to understand what to do, what has been done, and how to proceed. This entry point is where momentum is either built or broken. And yet, in many environments, especially at work, the entry point is treated not as a documented path but as an oral tradition—a conversation you must have with a specific person, at a specific time, often requiring social decoding more than actual knowledge.

This dependence on tribal knowledge is not only inefficient—it’s exclusionary. Neurotypicals may accept this friction as normal: “Just ask around,” they’ll say, as if that were free. But for many, especially neurodivergent thinkers who thrive on clarity and autonomy, this lack of written structure is a barrier. It turns a solvable problem into an opaque maze. The irony is that in most cases, the entry point could be distilled into a short README, a few paragraphs in markdown, a crisp diagram. Instead, we embed it in meetings, Slack messages, and half-remembered chats.

Designing a thoughtful entry point is an act of inclusion. It says: you don’t have to already be in the circle to begin. It respects time, attention, and the diversity of learning styles. And it scales. We should do it more.
