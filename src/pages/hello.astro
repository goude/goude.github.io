    <h2>Hi, thanks for reaching out 👋</h2>

    <p>
      To help me respond faster and more effectively (and protect focus time
      🧠), I really appreciate if <strong
        >you can include everything relevant in your first message</strong
      >. This means:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Say hello if you'd like, but <strong
          >then go straight to your question</strong
        >
        <sup><a href="https://nohello.net">[1]</a></sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        Please do not use @<span data-role="greeting"></span> mentions in 1:1 chats
        — it will not speed up my response
      </li>
      <li>
        Include <strong>enough context</strong> for me to understand and act on it
        <ul>
          <li>
            For example: ticket number, what you've tried, what you're blocked
            on.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        If it’s urgent, feel free to say so 🚨. But otherwise, I’ll reply as
        soon as I’m able
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This saves time for both of us, and lets me give you a clearer answer
      without needing a full chat-style back-and-forth.
    </p>

    <p>Here's an example:</p>

    <blockquote>
      Hey <span data-role="greeting"></span> — quick question re: INC12345. We’re
      getting a timeout in step 2 of the pipeline after yesterday’s change. Logs
      here:
      <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">link</a>. Do you know if anything
      changed on your side?
    </blockquote>

    <p>Thanks for helping make things smoother! 🙏</p>
