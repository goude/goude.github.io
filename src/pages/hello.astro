              Knowledge should not depend on who you know, timing, or luck.
              Writing and publishing clearly reduces friction, lowers social
              barriers, and treats documentation as infrastructure rather than
              folklore.

              Conversation is valuable and often irreplaceable. But people
              should not have to interrupt, guess, or chase access to do their
              job or understand a system.

              Writing is only half the work. Information should live in a place
              that is searchable, stable, and accessible to those who need it —
              including future versions of ourselves.
